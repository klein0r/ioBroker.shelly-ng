## State changes

By default, only if the value of a state changes, you will see the change. In this case, *Update objects even if there is no value change* is deactivated.

Example:

* shelly.0.SHBTN-1#A4CF12F454A3#1.Button.Event = 'S' (Last Changed Timestamp: 01.02.2020 10:20:00)
* shelly.0.SHBTN-1#A4CF12F454A3#1.Button.Event = 'S' (Last Changed Timestamp: 01.02.2020 **10:20:00**) - there is no change shown in ioBroker because the value is the same
* shelly.0.SHBTN-1#A4CF12F454A3#1.Button.Event = 'L' (Last Changed Timestamp: 01.02.2020 10:22:00)

If *Update objects even if there is no value change* is activated, the state will be updated without a value change. The only thing that will be changed in this case is the *Last Changed Timestamp*

Example:

* shelly.0.SHBTN-1#A4CF12F454A3#1.Button.Event = 'S' (Last Changed Timestamp: 01.02.2020 10:20:00)
* shelly.0.SHBTN-1#A4CF12F454A3#1.Button.Event = 'S' (Last Changed Timestamp: 01.02.2020 **10:21:00**) - timestamp change in ioBroker, value is the same
* shelly.0.SHBTN-1#A4CF12F454A3#1.Button.Event = 'L' (Last Changed Timestamp: 01.02.2020 10:22:00)
